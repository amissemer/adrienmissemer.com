SMS: ClickSend (1$ free credit upon new subscriptions)
Heroku: Free tier is fine, web app will sleep avec 30min, so I just need to ping it every 20min and it won't sleep. Heroku offers 900min of run time in the free tier, which allows for more than one web application full time.
Uptimerobot: http://uptimerobot.com/ totally free to monitor even every 5 min (which is better than the previous service I used for that before: http://www.monitor.us/). Thanks to the monitoring, my application never sleeps. And I get a nice emails if there is anything wrong.
